## N+1 Errors blog
This Rails app is built to support my "Avoiding N+1 Errors" talk at the Rails [Open Camp](http://railscamp.io/) in NYC, July 10, 2016.

The slides for this talk are at Slideshare: [Avoiding N+1 Errors in Rails Apps](http://www.slideshare.net/EstherLeytush/avoiding-n1-errors-in-rails-apps).
