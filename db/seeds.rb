  "1970 - Guy Steele and Gerald Sussman create Scheme. Their work leads to a series of 'Lambda the Ultimate' papers culminating in 'Lambda the Ultimate Kitchen Utensil.' This paper becomes the basis for a long running, but ultimately unsuccessful run of late night infomercials.

  "1995 - Brendan Eich reads up on every mistake ever made in designing a programming language, invents a few more, and creates LiveScript. Later, in an effort to cash in on the popularity of Java the language is renamed JavaScript.
